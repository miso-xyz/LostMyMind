## LostMyMind
what a clusterfuck of a deobfuscator, currently in very early stages (MindLated Deobfuscator)

## Notes:
The application is currently in very early early stages, don't expect it to work or to produce anything really usable
tldr: its not gonna magically work, dont use it just to reverse anything protected with MindLated since it cant do shit

## Protection Supported:
<pre>
- Simple & Equation-Based Math Calculations (can be improved a lot more)
- Calli fixer
- AntiDnspy Decompilation (Removes "MindLated.jpg" strings & fixes CFlow)

ToDo:
- Useless NOP Remover
- Calculation Detection
- just support for other protections
</pre>
