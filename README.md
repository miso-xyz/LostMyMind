# LostMyMind
what a clusterfuck of a deobfuscator, currently in very early stages (MindLated Deobfuscator)

# Protection Supported:
<pre>
- Simple & Equation-Based Math Calculations (can be improved a lot more)
- Calli fixer
- AntiDnspy Decompilation (Removes "MindLated.jpg" strings & fixes CFlow)

ToDo:
- Useless NOP Remover
- Calculation Detection
- just support for other protections
</pre>
